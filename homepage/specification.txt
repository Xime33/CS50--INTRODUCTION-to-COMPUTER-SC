CSS Properties Used:

background - Used to set the background of the page with a linear gradient.
height - Specifies the height of the body to ensure the background covers the entire page.
margin - Removes default margins to ensure the background and content fit properly.
color - Defines the text color as white to contrast with the dark background.

JavaScript and Bootstrap Use:

JavaScript: The script listens for the DOMContentLoaded event to ensure the DOM is fully loaded. Once the page is ready,
it attaches an event listener to the header (<header> with class jumbotron). When the header is clicked, an alert saying "Welcome to My Website!" is displayed.
Bootstrap: Used for the responsive layout of the page, including the navigation bar and the grid system that displays images in a neat format.
