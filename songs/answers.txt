i use this query to get the AVG for the parameters that spotify uses to discover the aura:
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

this are the results:
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+

We can see that a person with this averages is very motivated, the avg for danceability is almost 1, also the energy with a value of 0.65.
we can assume that this playlist has a motivated aura but with emotionals complexity due to the low value of valence
